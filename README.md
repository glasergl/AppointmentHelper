# AppointmentHelper
A set of tools to handle yearly events which occur on the same day every year (birhtdays, ...).

The whole tool contains three tools:
  - Editor: add, change, delete yearly appointments
  - Calendar: Overview of all stored appointments
  - Reminder: Shows appointments which occur today or tomorrow (at the time the program is executed)

Currently, there is an Adapter, too. It is used to migrate from an old version.

## How to use ##
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Run build-script.bat
  3. The output-Folder contains the three .exe-Files for the Editor, Calendar and Reminder (or a zip-Archive with all three)
